# Solving-Parks-Star-Battle
Two in-progress approaches to solving various instances of the puzzle known as "Parks" on the Android app store, or "Star Battle" in other sources, first developed by Hans Eendebak.

The evolutionary algorithm can generally solve puzzles of size 6 (6x6 squares), with a succes rate far higher than repeatedly trying random solutions, while the neural network solves the far simpler 4x4 puzzles with a high (90-99%) accuracy.
